# Performance-of-FlowSOM-with-different-arcsinh-normalizing-parameters

The code compares the performance of R package FlowSOM with different arcsinh normalizing parameters on 4 canonical datasets. The functions and datasets are derived from the article **Comparison of Clustering Methods for High-Dimensional Single-Cell Flow and Mass Cytometry Data**. Uncomment line 98 to set different normalizing parameters.
